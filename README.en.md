# StudentClaw

[中文](README.md)

> A human-powered execution platform with WeChat-native intake.  
> A graduate student stays in the loop, with `OpenClaw` or other agents used as on-demand reinforcement.

> Unofficial parody project; not affiliated with `OpenClaw`, `OpenAI`, `WeChat`, or related platforms. See the disclaimer below.

## Product Overview

`StudentClaw` is positioned for high-pressure, fragmented, time-sensitive work:  
requests arrive through WeChat, the system prioritizes them, a human execution layer carries the task forward, and external agents are pulled in only when structured generation or automation becomes the better fit.

Typical workloads include:

- research synthesis and information cleanup
- writing refinement and delivery follow-through
- deadline-driven emergency support
- tasks that still need human judgment and human fallback

## Launch Highlights

- **WeChat Native Interface**: tasks arrive through the channel people already use
- **Human Runtime**: the critical path stays human-driven and directly accountable
- **Agent Augmentation**: the operator can call `OpenClaw` or other agents on demand
- **Deadline-Aware Scheduling**: prioritization shifts with urgency, interruptions, and delivery windows
- **Typical Pricing**: commonly `¥400 / month`, with variation by lab, familiarity, and snack policy

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Operating System | A master's student's struggling laptop |
| Task Entry | A working WeChat conversation |
| Required Access | At least one of: `Advisor API` or `Professor API` |
| Optional Boost | `OpenClaw` or another external agent |
| Network | Good enough to send messages and hopefully receive replies |

### How to obtain `Advisor API` / `Professor API`

- This project does **not** ship with `Advisor API` or `Professor API`
- These permissions usually require you to **bring your own lab relationship** or receive access from your research group
- If your environment has neither `Advisor API` nor `Professor API`, many high-priority workflows will not complete end-to-end
- In short: the missing prerequisite is not the bug; the missing documentation was

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have at least one working privilege: `Advisor API` or `Professor API`  
2. Send the task, context, and delivery requirements through WeChat  
3. Let the routing layer decide priority and execution path  
4. `StudentAgent Runtime` handles execution, follow-through, and delivery  
5. Bring in external agents when automation becomes useful  
6. Return results and iterate until the task is closed

## Deployment

`StudentClaw` currently supports one deployment mode that best matches its overall product character:

### `Dorm-Room Single-Node Deluxe Deployment`

Default deployment shape:  
one struggling graduate-student laptop, one WeChat window, and a few half-awake `StudentAgent` nodes taking turns.

Its advantages are obvious:

- fast to start, effectively boot-and-serve
- physically close to the operator, so follow-up pressure works immediately
- can escalate to `OpenClaw` or other agents at any time

Its costs are also obvious:

- the fan noise often arrives before the result
- neither memory nor morale truly supports high concurrency
- the moment an advisor interrupts, the whole cluster collapses into single-threaded mode

## StudentAgent Switching & Context Carryover

`StudentClaw` does not guarantee complete automatic context carryover across `StudentAgent` nodes by default.  
In plain language: what you said in chat A may not be fully inherited in chat B.

The most common switching problems in the current version are:

- one task gets split across multiple `StudentAgent` nodes and nobody knows which thread is the latest
- new requirements were added in WeChat, but an older `StudentAgent` is still running the previous version
- urgency and emotional tone from `StudentAgent` A are not recognized by `StudentAgent` B
- after enough switching, the system enters “I remember you said this, but not which time” mode

Recommended practice:

1. keep one main `StudentAgent` node for one deliverable whenever possible  
2. whenever switching `StudentAgent` nodes, restate the current goal, deadline, and blockers  
3. if the task has already drifted, run the equivalent of `Chat-to-Task` before continuing  
4. do not assume `StudentClaw` can synchronize every context by sheer willpower

## When Local Run Fails

If your first local attempt at `StudentClaw` fails, that usually does not mean the system is down.  
More often, the privileges are incomplete, the context is too messy, or the graduate-student laptop surrendered first.

In the current version, local failure usually falls into one of these buckets:

- no `Advisor API` and no `Professor API`
- WeChat entry works, but the task description is too fragmented to route cleanly
- external agents are unavailable while the human lane is already saturated
- advisor interruption, deadline compression, and fan noise all arrive at the same time

In short, local failure is usually an environment problem, not an installation-technique problem.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Common Cause | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crashes immediately on start | Missing `Advisor API` or `Professor API` | Obtain at least one advisor-level privilege first |
| Tasks are sent but nobody moves | The flow got stuck in `Seen-But-No-Reply`, advisor interruption, or deadline pressure | Add missing context or wait for priority to settle |
| Output is painfully slow | Only the human lane is active and the machine is weak | Bring in `OpenClaw` or another external agent |
| Three revision rounds later, still no closure | The chat history is too fragmented and the task was never normalized | Run the equivalent of `Chat-to-Task` before continuing |
| The machine freezes outright | Heat, memory pressure, or morale collapsed first | Lower concurrency and protect the core deliverable |

## Comparison with OpenClaw

> This table is a parody positioning comparison. For official `OpenClaw` features, capabilities, and deployment details, refer to its official website and repository.

| Dimension | StudentClaw | OpenClaw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product category | Human-backed execution platform | Personal AI Assistant |
| Primary executor | Graduate student + caffeine | Local or self-hosted agent |
| Task entry | WeChat-first | Multi-channel messaging + local control plane |
| Control plane | Task routing, human judgment, and strategic disappearance | Local-first Gateway |
| Extensibility | Human tool use, agent fallback, and last-minute overtime | Tools, skills, routing, and multi-agent workflows |
| Cost structure | Commonly `¥400 / month`, still varying by lab, familiarity, and late-night snack policy | Self-hosted software plus model / deployment costs |
| Failure mode | Seen-but-no-reply, advisor interruptions, deadline compression | Configuration, permission, runtime, and security-policy issues |
| Best fit | High-pressure tasks that need human fallback | Long-running personal AI assistant workflows |

## Plans & Service Level

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Standard Plan | Commonly `¥400 / month` |
| Pricing Basis | Moves up or down depending on lab, funding mood, relationship quality, and snack expectations |
| Token Policy | Theoretically unmetered, practically limited by how long a human can keep going |
| Response SLA | Fast on a good day, “I saw it” on a bad one |
| Escalation Policy | Brings in `OpenClaw` or other agents when the human layer is cooked |
| Autoscaling | Elastic capacity powered by caffeine, anxiety, and approaching deadlines |

## Use Cases

- delivery windows are short, but full automation is still risky
- someone needs to watch the process, details, and rework
- the request stream already lives in WeChat

## FAQ

### Is this a real product?

No.  
Please do not actually try to place an order.

### Does it actually support WeChat task dispatch?

Within the premise of the joke, yes.  
As a real shipped product feature, no.

### Can I use this without `Advisor API` or `Professor API`?

Not well.  
Some baseline paths may exist, but many critical workflows assume at least one advisor-level permission.

### Where do I get `Advisor API` / `Professor API` access?

The project does not provide it.  
Usually you either bring it yourself, receive it from your lab, or earn it through long-term relationship maintenance.

### Why compare it with `OpenClaw`?

Because most people immediately want to know how this thing is supposed to differ from `OpenClaw`.

### Is this endorsing student exploitation?

No.  
The point is to expose how uncomfortable that logic already is, not endorse it.

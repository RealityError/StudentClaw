# StudentClaw

[中文](README.md)

> A human-powered execution platform with WeChat-native intake.  
> A graduate student stays in the loop, with `OpenClaw` or other agents used as on-demand reinforcement.

> Unofficial parody project; not affiliated with `OpenClaw`, `OpenAI`, `WeChat`, or related platforms. See the disclaimer below.

## Product Overview

`StudentClaw` is positioned for high-pressure, fragmented, time-sensitive work:  
requests arrive through WeChat, the system prioritizes them, a human execution layer carries the task forward, and external agents are pulled in only when structured generation or automation becomes the better fit.

Typical workloads include:

- research synthesis and information cleanup
- writing refinement and delivery follow-through
- deadline-driven emergency support
- tasks that still need human judgment and human fallback

## Launch Highlights

- **WeChat Native Interface**: tasks arrive through the channel people already use
- **Human Runtime**: the critical path stays human-driven and directly accountable
- **Agent Augmentation**: the operator can call `OpenClaw` or other agents on demand
- **Deadline-Aware Scheduling**: prioritization shifts with urgency, interruptions, and delivery windows
- **Flexible Pricing**: strictly above `¥0`, varying by lab, familiarity, and snack policy

## Skills

| Skill | Description | Best For | Agent Escalation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Deadline Rescue` | Prioritizes delivery under deadline pressure and pulls the result together fast. | Last-minute drafts, missing materials, final-round edits | Supported |
| `Seen-But-No-Reply` | Detects stalled threads and drags silent tasks back into motion. | Follow-ups, chasing replies, repeated pings | Optional |
| `Advisor Interrupt` | Handles sudden high-priority interruptions by reordering the queue. | Incoming urgent requests, broken schedules | Not needed |
| `Chat-to-Task` | Converts messy chat context into a concrete task list and deliverables. | Fragmented requirements, scattered context | Optional |
| `First-Draft First` | Produces a usable first pass, then tightens it through feedback loops. | Drafting, outlining, explanatory writing | Supported |
| `Human Saturation Fallback` | Switches to external agents when the human execution layer is overloaded. | Bulk rewriting, structured generation, repetitive work | Default on |

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Operating System | A master's student's struggling laptop |
| Task Entry | A working WeChat conversation |
| Required Access | At least one of: `Advisor API` or `Professor API` |
| Optional Boost | `OpenClaw` or another external agent |
| Network | Good enough to send messages and hopefully receive replies |

### How to obtain `Advisor API` / `Professor API`

- This project does **not** ship with `Advisor API` or `Professor API`
- These permissions usually require you to **bring your own lab relationship** or receive access from your research group
- If your environment has neither `Advisor API` nor `Professor API`, many high-priority workflows will not complete end-to-end
- In short: the missing prerequisite is not the bug; the missing documentation was

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have at least one working privilege: `Advisor API` or `Professor API`  
2. Send the task, context, and delivery requirements through WeChat  
3. Let the routing layer decide priority and execution path  
4. `Student Runtime` handles execution, follow-through, and delivery  
5. Bring in external agents when automation becomes useful  
6. Return results and iterate until the task is closed

### Architecture Notes

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| WeChat Gateway | Receives requests, context, and follow-up instructions |
| Task Router | Classifies work, assigns priority, and selects execution path |
| Priority Queue | Reorders work based on deadlines, urgency, and interruptions |
| Student Runtime | Human execution layer responsible for judgment, handling, and delivery |
| Agent Adapter | External capability layer for `OpenClaw` or other agents |
| Result Delivery | Sends results back, handles revision requests, and closes the loop |

## Comparison with OpenClaw

> This table is a parody positioning comparison. For official `OpenClaw` features, capabilities, and deployment details, refer to its official website and repository.

| Dimension | StudentClaw | OpenClaw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product category | Human-backed execution platform | Personal AI Assistant |
| Primary executor | Graduate student + caffeine | Local or self-hosted agent |
| Task entry | WeChat-first | Multi-channel messaging + local control plane |
| Control plane | Task routing, human judgment, and strategic disappearance | Local-first Gateway |
| Extensibility | Human tool use, agent fallback, and last-minute overtime | Tools, skills, routing, and multi-agent workflows |
| Cost structure | Strictly above `¥0`, varying by lab, familiarity, and late-night snack policy | Self-hosted software plus model / deployment costs |
| Failure mode | Seen-but-no-reply, advisor interruptions, deadline compression | Configuration, permission, runtime, and security-policy issues |
| Best fit | High-pressure tasks that need human fallback | Long-running personal AI assistant workflows |

## Plans & Service Level

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Standard Plan | `> ¥0 / month` |
| Pricing Basis | Varies by lab, funding mood, relationship quality, and snack expectations |
| Token Policy | Theoretically unmetered, practically limited by how long a human can keep going |
| Response SLA | Fast on a good day, “I saw it” on a bad one |
| Escalation Policy | Brings in `OpenClaw` or other agents when the human layer is cooked |
| Autoscaling | Elastic capacity powered by caffeine, anxiety, and approaching deadlines |

## Use Cases

- delivery windows are short, but full automation is still risky
- someone needs to watch the process, details, and rework
- the request stream already lives in WeChat

## FAQ

### Is this a real product?

No.  
Please do not actually try to place an order.

### Does it actually support WeChat task dispatch?

Within the premise of the joke, yes.  
As a real shipped product feature, no.

### Can I use this without `Advisor API` or `Professor API`?

Not well.  
Some baseline paths may exist, but many critical workflows assume at least one advisor-level permission.

### Where do I get `Advisor API` / `Professor API` access?

The project does not provide it.  
Usually you either bring it yourself, receive it from your lab, or earn it through long-term relationship maintenance.

### Why compare it with `OpenClaw`?

Because most people immediately want to know how this thing is supposed to differ from `OpenClaw`.

### Is this endorsing student exploitation?

No.  
The point is to expose how uncomfortable that logic already is, not endorse it.
